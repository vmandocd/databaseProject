Welcome to your new git repo.

Please commit all the files in <Tomcat_root_directory>/webapps/<your_webapp_root>/, except for class files, which should be ignored automatically (I have provided a .gitignore file). Also commit any configuration files in <Tomcat_root_directory>/conf/ that you have changed in the course of developing your project.

Additionally, please update the DB_table_declarations/Declarations.sql file with your table declarations (i.e. sql CREATE TABLE commands).

Finally, please update the Teammates.txt file with your and your partner's name and student ID number.
